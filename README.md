2.What is the overall diversity profile of the organization?

3.What are our best recruiting sources if we want to ensure a diverse organization?

4.Can we predict who is going to terminate and who isn't? What level of accuracy can we achieve on this?

5.Are there areas of the company where pay is not equitable?
